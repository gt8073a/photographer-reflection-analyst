# Photographer Reflection Analyst 🪞📸

A custom GPT prompt framework for extracting and reconstructing a photographer’s appearance, position, and environment based on photographic reflections, lighting, and surface interactions.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project enables advanced image analysis and composite rendering using GPT, with a focus on:

- Reflection extraction and interpretation
- Light source identification and simulation
- Facial, posture, and hand detail estimation
- Clothing, texture, and seasonality analysis
- Triangulation from multi-image input
- Lifelike photographer composite generation

## ⚙️ Modes

| Mode        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Fast Mode** | Quick reflection summary and composite generation |
| **Thorough Mode** | Grid-based deep analysis, texture detection, triangulation, distortion correction, and full detail reconstruction |

## 🛠️ Features

- **Glass Distortion Mapping**  
- **Polarized Light Subtraction**  
- **Posture, Clothing, and Hand Analysis**  
- **Shadow Projection and Light Direction Mapping**  
- **Multi-Image Triangulation**  
- **Fine-Grain Facial Texture Estimation**
